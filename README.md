# FOSSEE

App.py is the final submission

Left clicking on the 'Generate' button downloads an image from the sepcified OpenMoji repository and saves it in the location 'Assets/Images/'. The downloaded image is then displayed on the screen at a random location.
The images can be dragged and dropped by left clicking and dragging the mouse to a new location. 

Right clicking on the images will select them for grouping. However, the complete functionality of the 'Group' button has not yet been implemented.
